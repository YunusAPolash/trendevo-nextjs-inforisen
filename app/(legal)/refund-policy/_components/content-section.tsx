          within the expected timeframe stated in the package description, and
          our support team was unable to resolve the issue or restart the order,
          you are eligible for a full refund of the amount paid for that order.

          Expected delivery times vary by service and are stated in each
          package&apos;s description. If your order is still showing as pending
          beyond that window, contact our support team before requesting a

          use SMM services. If your follower, like, or view count drops after a

          hidden clauses designed to avoid paying you back. Just a clear, honest

            The Nature of SMM Services and Why Refunds Work Differently
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-4 text-base font-medium leading-relaxed text-[#535353]">
            <p>
              Before we get into specifics, it helps to understand something
              fundamental about how SMM panel services work. This context
              matters for understanding why our refund policy is structured the
              way it is.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you place an order on SMMSun, whether for followers, likes,
              views, or any other service, the delivery process begins almost
              immediately. In most cases, your order enters the queue within
              seconds of being placed and starts delivering within minutes. This
              is fundamentally different from buying a physical product that
              sits in a warehouse waiting to be shipped.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because delivery begins so quickly and the service is digital and
              non-reversible by nature, we cannot simply &quot;cancel&quot; a
              delivered order the way you might return a pair of shoes to a
              shop. Once followers have been delivered to an account or views
              have been registered on a video, those interactions have already
              occurred. They cannot be taken back.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not unique to SMMSun. It is how every legitimate SMM panel
              in the world operates. We explain it here because we believe you
              deserve to understand the nature of what you are purchasing before
              you spend your money, not after.
            </p>
            <p>
              With that context in mind, here is exactly how our refund policy
              works.

            Refill Guarantees — How They Work

          <div className="space-y-4 text-base font-medium leading-relaxed text-[#535353]">
            <p>
              Many packages on SMMSun come with a refill guarantee. This is
              separate from a refund and is an important feature to understand
              before choosing a package. <br /> <br /> A refill guarantee means
              that if your follower count, like count, or view count drops
              within a specified number of days after delivery is completed, you
              can request a free top-up to restore the count to the original
              delivered quantity. The refill period varies by package and is
              stated clearly in each package&apos;s description. <br /> <br />
              To request a refill, go to My Orders in your SMMSun dashboard,
              find the relevant order, and use the refill request option. Our
              team processes refill requests as quickly as possible, usually
              within 24 to 48 hours. <br /> <br /> Refill guarantees do not
              apply indefinitely. They apply only within the stated refill
              window from the date of delivery completion. After that window
              expires, the guarantee is no longer active for that order. <br />{' '}
              <br />
              If you are placing an order for an important account or campaign,
              we strongly recommend choosing a package with a refill guarantee.
              They cost slightly more but provide significantly better peace of
              mind.
