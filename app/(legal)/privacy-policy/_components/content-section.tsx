            other platforms. We store passwords in encrypted form and never store

            records. Transaction records are retained for a minimum period

            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as our platform

            in Bangladesh change. When we make meaningful changes, we will update
            the date at the top of this page. For significant changes that
            materially affect how your data is handled, we will notify registered
            users via email. Your continued use of SMMSun after any update to
