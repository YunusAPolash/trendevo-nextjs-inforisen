          <p>
            SMMSun is a social media marketing panel operating through
            smmsun.com. We are based in Bangladesh and have been serving users
            since 2020. Our platform provides social media growth services
            including followers, likes, views, comments, shares, watch time, and
            related services across major platforms including Facebook,
            Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Telegram, and X (formerly Twitter).
          </p>
          <p>
            We serve individual content creators, small and medium businesses,
            digital marketing agencies, freelancers, and resellers across
            Bangladesh and internationally. You can learn more about who we are
            on our About Us page.

        <TermsBlock number={2} title="Eligibility — Who Can Use Trend Evo">
          <p>To use SMMSun, you must meet the following conditions.</p>
          <p>
            You must be at least 18 years of age. SMMSun is not intended for use
            by minors. If you are under 18, you are not permitted to create an
            account or place orders on our platform.

          <p>
            You must be a human individual or a legitimately operating business.
            Automated account creation is not permitted. You must provide
            accurate information when registering. Creating an account with
            false information, including a fake email address, is a violation of
            these terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            You must have the legal authority to use the social media accounts
            and content you submit orders for. Placing orders on accounts that
            you do not own or manage, without the account owner&apos;s knowledge
            or consent, is a violation of these terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are using SMMSun on behalf of a business or organisation, you
            represent that you have the authority to bind that entity to these
            terms.

          </p>
          <p>
            You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account.
            This means using a strong, unique password and not sharing your
            login credentials with anyone you do not trust. SMMSun will never
            ask you for your password. If anyone contacts you claiming to be
            from SMMSun and asks for your account password or any social media
            password, do not share it and report the contact to us immediately

          <p>
            SMMSun provides social media growth services delivered through our
            online panel at smmsun.com. Services are available for purchase by
            registered users who have added funds to their account balance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each service listed on our platform includes a description of what
            is being delivered, the expected delivery timeframe, the price per
            unit, and where applicable, the refill guarantee period. Please read
            the service description carefully before placing any order.
          </p>
          <p>
            Services are delivered to the public URL or username you provide at
            the time of ordering. It is your responsibility to ensure that the
            link or username you enter is correct and that the target account or
            content is publicly accessible at the time of and throughout the
            delivery period.

          <p>
            SMMSun acts as an intermediary between you and our service delivery
            network. We coordinate delivery on your behalf but do not guarantee
            specific outcomes beyond the quantity and service type stated in the
            package description. Social media platforms are independent third
            parties whose algorithms, policies, and technical systems are
            outside our control.

        <TermsBlock number={5} title="Payments, Pricing, and Account Balance">
          <p>
            All prices on SMMSun are displayed in Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) unless
            otherwise stated. Prices are inclusive of all applicable fees from
            our side. There are no hidden charges added at checkout.

            balance. We accept the following payment methods: bKash, Nagad,
            Rocket, Upay, Cellfin, Visa, Mastercard, Binance Pay, and Payeer.

          <p>
            Account balance funds are non-refundable as cash withdrawals. Once
            funds are added to your SMMSun balance, they can be used for
            services on our platform but cannot be transferred back to your
            bKash, Nagad, or other payment account. Please refer to our{' '}

            SMMSun is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or in any way officially

            Social media platforms periodically update their algorithms,
